1. select nth maxmium value, change offset and get values, now get 3rd maximum value...
SELECT title FROM comments ORDER BY title LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2

2. SQL to find the number of distinct values in a column
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT column_name) AS some_alias FROM table_name

3. SQL to find the number of distinct values in a column with column name.
select columnName, count(columnName) as CountOf from tableName group by columnName

4. SQL INNER JOIN Keyword
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name=table2.column_name;
SQL update query in echo format php
$sql = "Update wp_social_feeds SET status='".$_POST["status"]."'WHERE id='".$_POST["id"]."'";

query get child record with parent
SELECT *
FROM wp_imh_meal_calendar
INNER JOIN post_repeat
ON wp_imh_meal_calendar.repeat_id=post_repeat.id
WHERE wp_imh_meal_calendar.id=44

another important join query in which get  parent and child record with some additional fields
$query = "SELECT *, COUNT(*) AS total, MAX(start_date) AS last_start_date, MAX(end_date) AS last_end_date
 				FROM wp_imh_meal_calendar
				INNER JOIN post_repeat ON post_repeat.id = wp_imh_meal_calendar.repeat_id
				WHERE post_repeat.ends = '1'
				GROUP BY post_repeat.id";

only compare date in datetime field
SELECT * FROM `wp_imh_meal_calendar` WHERE CAST(`start_date` AS DATE) = '2016-06-30'

git command for clone any branch
git clone https://gitlab.com/Techliance/WeSee.git --branch yasirwork --single-branch

Update only time in date time field
UPDATE wp_imh_meal_calendar SET 
start_date = concat_ws(' ',date(start_date), '17:00:00')
WHERE 1 ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 3

Qurery for get substring between two characters sql
SELECT post_type, post_link,SUBSTRING(`post_link`, LOCATE('1015', post_link), (LOCATE('637', post_link)+ CHAR_LENGTH(637))-LOCATE('1015', post_link)) from `wp_social_feeds` where post_type = 'facebook'

Qurery for get substring after characters sql use -1 to 1 for before character
select SUBSTRING_INDEX(post_link, '1015', -1) from `wp_social_feeds` where post_type = 'facebook'

delete all duplicate rows except for one in mysql
1) If you want to keep the row with the lowest id value:

DELETE n1 FROM names n1, names n2 WHERE n1.id > n2.id AND n1.name = n2.name
2) If you want to keep the row with the highest id value:

DELETE n1 FROM `wp_social_feeds` n1, `wp_social_feeds` n2 WHERE n1.id < n2.id AND n1.post_link = n2.post_link
Quiery for null lat long after comparison between two table
update `schools` set `lat` = null, `long` = null where code in(
select code from (
SELECT s.code, FLOOR(s.`lat`) as s_lat, FLOOR(s.`long`) as s_long, Floor(c.lat) as c_lat, Floor(c.long) as c_long  
from `schools` as s 
join `communities` as c where s.community_code = c.code) as t
where (s_lat != c_lat or s_long != c_long))
